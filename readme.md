# Advent of Code 2020

This repository is my solutions for Advent of Code 2020 challenges created in Rust language.
The solutions here are result of me putting in the effort to learn Rust and thus might not
be the most elegant solutions possible.

## How to run these?

Use command "cargo test" to test all solutions.
Use command "cargo run --bin _name_" to run specific solution and see its output.  

### Input data

The developers of Advent of Code have requested that players do not share their input data.

Each solution will look for file ".aoc-session" in current folder which contains the Advent
of Code session cookie. If session file is not found, the solution will run with hard-coded
example data.
